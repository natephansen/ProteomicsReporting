# Proteomics Reporting (Demo)

This repository contains an **example output report** generated by a proteomics data analysis pipeline I developed in my current role.  

Because this pipeline was created for internal projects, the source code cannot be shared. Instead, this repository demonstrates the type of interactive HTML reports the pipeline produces. These reports are the final deliverables that collaborators receive for exploration and interpretation.

## What the Pipeline Does

The pipeline is designed to take raw proteomics data from start to finish:

1. **Data Ingestion** â€“ Reads in raw proteomics data tables.  
2. **Normalization** â€“ Applies appropriate normalization methods to ensure comparability across samples.  
3. **Statistical Analysis** â€“ Runs group comparisons, significance testing, and corrections for multiple testing.  
4. **Reporting** â€“ Automatically generates an interactive HTML report with:  
   - Summary tables  
   - Interactive plots and figures  
   - Highlighted significant findings

## Behind the Pipeline

- **Languages**: R for data analysis and statistical modeling, HTML/CSS/JS for reporting and interactivity  
- **Automation**: Pipeline built to run end-to-end without manual intervention  
- **Portability**: Run within a containerized environment, making it fully reproducible

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository exists to showcase the type of deliverables I build. While the underlying pipeline code remains proprietary, the interactive HTML report illustrates the quality and clarity of the outputs collaborators receive.  

It highlights my experience in:  
- Developing automated, reproducible pipelines  
- Applying statistical methods to biological data  
- Creating intuitive, interactive reporting for non-technical stakeholders
